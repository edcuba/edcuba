## Hey there! üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª

I'm a Software Engineer curious about AI & Machine Learning (especially GNNs, GANs, RL, and DL), Data Analysis, Cybersecurity, and Quantum Computing. I'm a [BUT](https://www.vut.cz/en/) alumni, now at [UZH](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en.html), also a former [Dreamer](https://dreamlab.net/en/) and [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en).

I work at [CERN Openlab](https://openlab.cern/), exploring the overlaps of High Performance Computing, Machine Learning and Quantum Computing, and playing with Graph Neural Networks for improving particle reconstructions at the [CMS](https://home.cern/science/experiments/cms) Experiment.
