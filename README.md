## Hey there! üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª

I'm a Software Engineer curious about AI & Machine Learning (especially GNNs, GANs, RL, and DL), Data Analysis, Cybersecurity, and Quantum Computing. I'm a [BUT](https://www.vut.cz/en/) alumni, now at [UZH](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en.html), also a former [Dreamer](https://dreamlab.net/en/) and [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en).

I work at [CERN Openlab](https://openlab.cern/), exploring the overlaps of High Performance Computing, Machine Learning and Quantum Computing, and playing with Graph Neural Networks for improving particle reconstructions at the [CMS](https://home.cern/science/experiments/cms) Experiment.

### I ‚ù§Ô∏è Open Source!

I contributed to open-source projects in:
- RPM software management: [DNF](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/dnf), [libdnf](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/libdnf), [ci-dnf-stack](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/ci-dnf-stack)
- Cyber security: [Arkime](https://github.com/arkime/arkime), [tcpflow](https://github.com/simsong/tcpflow)
- AI for HPC in HEP: [HEP benchmarking](https://gitlab.cern.ch/hep-benchmarks), [Particleflow](https://github.com/jpata/particleflow)

and published a series of my own projects like [Faqtie](https://faqtie.com), have a look!
